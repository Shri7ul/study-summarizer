📘 Part 1 Summary:
Here's a summary of the lecture content:

*   **Course Name:** Computer Architecture (CSE-313)
*   **Textbook:** "Computer Organization & Design" by Patterson & Hennessy (5th Edition or newer)
*   **How you get marks:**
    *   Being in class: 5 marks
    *   Tests (best 2 out of 4): 40 marks
    *   Homework (2 assignments): 10 marks
    *   Mid-term exam: 20 marks
    *   Final exam: 25 marks
    *   Total: 100 marks

📘 Part 2 Summary:
Here is a summary of the lecture:

*   This course teaches how computers work.
*   You will learn about computer instructions, called MIPS.
*   We will study how to build a MIPS computer's "brain" (processor).
*   You will learn how fast computers are and how to make them faster.
*   We will cover how computers use memory and talk to other devices.
*   Computer programs come in two main types:
    *   Programs you use (like games or email).
    *   Programs that help the computer run (like the operating system).

📘 Part 3 Summary:
Here is a summary of the lecture content:

*   **Hardware:** These are the computer's physical parts.
    *   **CPU:** The computer's "brain."
    *   **Memory:** Stores information (like RAM, ROM).
    *   **I/O Devices:** Tools to put in or get out information (like mouse, keyboard, screen).
*   **Operating System (OS):** This program helps your programs talk to the hardware and manages the computer.
    *   **OS functions:** Handles basic input/output, gives space for memory, and lets many programs run at once.
    *   **OS examples:** Windows, Linux, MacOS.
*   **Compiler:** This tool changes programs written in human-like languages (like C, Java) into instructions the computer hardware can understand and run.

📘 Part 4 Summary:
Here's a summary of the lecture content:

*   **MIPS** stands for Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages.
*   An **Assembler** is a program that changes instruction symbols into computer code.
*   **Assembly Language** is a symbolic way to write computer instructions.
